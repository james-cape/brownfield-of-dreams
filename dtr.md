Project: Brownfield of Dreams

Group Member Names: James Cape, Martin Mercer

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

James: I want to get fluent in API consumption and work together efficiently.

Martin: I too want to get fluent in API consumption. I want to find the rhythm within this new iteration of rails where we have so many files and so many things to keep track of. Certainly working together efficiently.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

James: Paired: Willing to put in a lot of time and grit. Even-tempered and patient with making sure both team members have a functional grasp of the material.

Martin: When in a paired situation, I do well with high frequency collaboration, ideally in a driver-navigator style of pairing. Glad to work toward mutual understanding of concepts.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

James: I'm personally willing to put in long hours and don't expect the other person to if their schedule is different than mine. I also think the project board will be very important to my own peace of mind.

Martin: By identifying patterns both in the written code and in the process of writing that code / reading our errors.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):

James: I usually get to Turing around 8am and leave around 7:00pm. I also usually get on the computer when I get home. None of my hours are rigid, and I'm happy to come in earlier or stay later.

Martin: Ideally, I would like to be home by 7 in the evening. My partner gets off work then, and I’d like time with him. That said, I work well in the mornings, and can get to school early if need-be. I’m also willing to work over the weekend. With the upcoming holiday weekend, having both Thursday and Sunday off would be ideal (especially since the HVAC won’t be on)

Weekends: Arrive at 9am, leave by 6:30pm.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):

James: I'd like to do a push/pull to master once per day so we keep working from a similar place if we split work up. I'm available any time - best is probably slack or text. Verbal and in person - it sounds like we'll have a lot of pair time.

Martin: We’ll get into a communication pattern pretty quickly, but I’d say that I’d prefer pairing for most of the project, so frequent and open communication, using Slack when necessary but otherwise verbal. Rigid structure wanted. Meaning, a lot of time and effort to make decisions about how something was going to be structured, or how something was going to be written, and with how many helper methods, etc. I think I’d like a rule where if we’ve been stuck on something for a half hour, we move on and come back to it within the next hour or so.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

James: I want to get good at Postman, and also API consumption.

Martin: I’d like to feel competent in API consumption and analyzing the data we’re receiving from the API (postman). That said, I’d also like to feel more sure-footed with the concepts presented in Week 1, such as JSON processing?

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

James: Workload - I’m reluctant but okay with submitting an incomplete project if it meant my mental health stayed intact. With that said, a complete project to spec is ideal.

Martin: Workload: we’ll take a look at the project board and see how we’ll organize it over the project period. As far as my own workload, I prefer equal parts. I’m more aware than over that my mental health must take priority over Turing’s demands.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

James: I would like to mutually agree not to work on Master. Let’s also add actually reviewing each other’s code / owning each other’s code.

Martin: Agreed on both fronts.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

James: I acknowledge this can be an awkward subject, but keeping it objective, non-biased, and improvement-driven makes it helpful for both partners.

Martin: Objective, specific, and kind feedback.

Project management tools we will use:

James: Github project board.

Martin: ^

Day 1 Agenda:

James: Get project board set up, look through and organize user stories to work on in some strategic order. Get github repo set up with contributors. Get started on one user story.

Martin: Same
